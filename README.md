While "ipfs daemon" is running on another shell

1. Run deploy_and_create.py 
2. Run create_collectible.py (it's gets run when with deploy_and_create but can still run seperately if our contract is already deployed)
3. Run create_metadata.py
4. Run set_tokenuri.py (Deploys it our NFT on the OpenSea testnet)
